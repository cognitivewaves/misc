# Reducing header file dependencies

This is a simple brute force method of reducing superfluous header includes in a project. Details can be seen in the post [Header file dependencies](https://cognitivewaves.wordpress.com/2017/04/14/header-file-dependencies/).

* Copy the files `build.bat` and `check-header-includes.py` to a working directory
* In `check-header-includes.py` modify the editable section (line 24) to point to your environment
* Execute `check-header-includes.py`
